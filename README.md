# Books I've read in 2019 so far

I'm not a big fan of new year's resolutions but I finally decided to form some success habits to become a better person in 2019 than I was in 2018. One of my habbits I've chosen is reading books. I've always been a book guy but I've never really read as many books as I wanted. So my goal is for 2019 is finishing 24 books by the end of the year which means 2 books in each month.
Let's get started. Here's the list of books I've already read:

1. [Habit Stacking: 127 Small Changes to Improve Your Health, Wealth, and Happiness](https://amzn.to/2GHlZIW)

2. [The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph](https://amzn.to/2SPRNlw)

3. [The Millionaire Fastlane: Crack the Code to Wealth and Live Rich for a Lifetime!](https://amzn.to/2TUKlTC)
